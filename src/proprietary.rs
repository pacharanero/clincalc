//! Proprietary / licence-locked calculators.
//!
//! Some clinical tools cannot be shipped openly because their algorithm is a
//! trade secret (e.g. FRAX) or their content is copyrighted and licence-locked
//! (e.g. the MMSE). This project refuses to ship a half-right reimplementation
//! or to quietly omit them. Instead each is registered as a first-class
//! calculator whose computation returns a structured explanation: that it is
//! proprietary, who owns it, what open alternatives exist (often one this
//! project already ships), and what a thwarted clinician can do about it.
//!
//! The point is transparency, not obstruction: a clinician searching for FRAX
//! finds out exactly why it is not here and where to turn, rather than silence.
