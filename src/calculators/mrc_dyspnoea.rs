//! MRC Dyspnoea Scale - a five-point grade of breathlessness.
//!
//! The Medical Research Council (MRC) breathlessness scale (Fletcher, 1959)
//! grades the disability that breathlessness causes during day-to-day
//! activities, on a single ordinal scale from grade 1 (breathless only on
//! strenuous exertion) to grade 5 (too breathless to leave the house). It is
//! the version in routine UK use, recommended by NICE (NG115) and the British
//! Thoracic Society for COPD assessment.
//!
//! This is the classic MRC scale (grades 1-5). A modified form (mMRC) renumbers
//! the same descriptors 0-4; mMRC grade = MRC grade - 1. The two are otherwise
//! identical in wording, so a grade quoted without a scale is ambiguous - this
//! calculator takes the classic 1-5 grade.
