//! CHALICE - Children's Head injury ALgorithm for the prediction of Important
//! Clinical Events (paediatric head injury CT decision rule).
//!
//! Unlike the numeric scores elsewhere in this crate, CHALICE is a *decision
//! rule*: it does not add points. If ANY single criterion is positive, a CT
//! head scan is recommended, because the presence of any one criterion predicts
//! a clinically significant intracranial injury. The rule was derived with a
//! sensitivity of 98% for clinically significant head injury (Dunning et al,
//! Arch Dis Child 2006), and is reflected in NICE head-injury guidance
//! (CG176, updated NG232).
//!
//! Two criteria are age-dependent and easy to get subtly wrong, so age is taken
//! as a single numeric input from which an `under 1 year` flag is derived:
//! - GCS: the threshold is < 14, but tightens to < 15 for infants under 1 year.
//! - Bruise/swelling/laceration > 5 cm: this criterion applies ONLY to infants
//!   under 1 year; in older children such a finding is not, by itself, a CHALICE
//!   indication.
//!
//! Criteria are grouped as History, Examination, and Mechanism per the original
//! algorithm, and the response lists exactly which criteria were positive.
