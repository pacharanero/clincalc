//! Waterlow Score - pressure ulcer (pressure injury) risk.
//!
//! Judy Waterlow's bedside risk-assessment card (1985, revised 2005). The total
//! is a sum of weighted categories: the higher the score the greater the risk of
//! a patient developing a pressure ulcer. The card is deliberately additive -
//! several categories let more than one descriptor apply at once - and it is this
//! additivity, not a single worst-case selection, that distinguishes Waterlow
//! from simpler scales such as Norton.
//!
//! Modelling decisions (documented because the card is genuinely complex):
//! - Most categories are mutually-exclusive single choices and are modelled as a
//!   Rust enum per category (Build, Continence, Mobility), so contradictory
//!   inputs are impossible.
//! - "Skin type / visual risk areas" is explicitly additive on the card (a
//!   patient can be both dry AND oedematous), so it is modelled as a set of
//!   independent booleans and the contributions are summed. The card's own
//!   guidance is to ring every applicable descriptor.
//! - "Sex and age" contribute as two independent axes (a sex point AND an age
//!   band point), so sex is an enum and age is numeric with derived bands,
//!   mirroring the CHA2DS2-VASc treatment of age.
//! - The "special risks" boxes (tissue malnutrition, neurological deficit, major
//!   surgery / trauma, medication) are each modelled as an enum of the card's
//!   listed options, taking the single highest applicable value within each box
//!   (the card lists discrete severities, not additive ticks, within a box),
//!   while the four boxes themselves sum.
//! - Nutrition: the 2005 card embeds a small malnutrition screen (recent weight
//!   loss + poor appetite/intake). This project ships the full BAPEN MUST tool
//!   only as a proprietary stub (BAPEN holds copyright), so this module does NOT
//!   reproduce MUST. Instead it models the nutrition contribution exactly as the
//!   Waterlow card itself states it: a weight-loss severity enum plus two
//!   independent flags ("eating poorly / lack of appetite" and "acutely ill or
//!   no nutritional intake > 5 days"), summed. These are Waterlow's own fields,
//!   not a reproduction of the MUST instrument.
//!
//! Risk bands (per the card): 10+ at risk; 15+ high risk; 20+ very high risk.
