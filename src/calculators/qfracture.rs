//! QFracture-2012 - 10-year risk of osteoporotic and hip fracture (Hippisley-Cox & Coupland, BMJ 2009/2012).
//!
//! The open UK fracture-risk algorithm and the intended open alternative to FRAX
//! (whose coefficients are an unpublished trade secret, so FRAX ships here only as
//! a proprietary protest stub). QFracture predicts the percentage probability that
//! a person will sustain a fracture within 10 years, reported as two outcomes:
//! a major *osteoporotic* fracture (hip, vertebral, proximal humerus, or distal
//! radius) and, separately, a *hip* fracture.
//!
//! This is a sex-stratified Cox fractional-polynomial model: separate male and
//! female equations for each outcome, each summing fractional-polynomial
//! transforms of age and BMI, centred continuous predictors, conditional
//! ethnicity / smoking / alcohol coefficients, and a set of boolean comorbidity
//! and risk-factor coefficients, then converting the linear predictor through a
//! baseline-survival constant indexed by follow-up year (here, year 10).
//!
//! The four equations do not all use the same factors, exactly as published:
//! - Only the female equations use endocrine problems and HRT/oestrogen.
//! - Only the male equations use care-home residence.
//! - The osteoporotic equations use malabsorption and a parental history of
//!   osteoporosis/hip fracture; the hip equations drop malabsorption, and the
//!   female hip equation also drops parental history.
//!
//! Inputs that a given equation does not use are simply ignored for that
//! sex/outcome (mirroring how the source omits them), so the same input set can
//! drive every model without contradictory shapes.
//!
//! Coefficients, survivor baselines, and centring constants are transcribed
//! verbatim from ClinRisk's open-source reference C implementation (Copyright 2012
//! ClinRisk Ltd., released under the LGPL v3+ to enable faithful reimplementation;
//! female equations from the `*_2_0` sources, male from the `*_2_1` sources), and
//! validated digit-for-digit against scores produced by compiling and running that
//! original C algorithm (see the tests below).
//!
//! Two subtleties are encoded to avoid silent error:
//! - BMI is derived from height and weight rather than accepted directly. The
//!   model is highly sensitive to BMI, and the fractional-polynomial transform
//!   makes a wrong BMI hard to spot; deriving it removes that footgun.
//! - Smoking has five ordered categories, alcohol six, and ethnicity nine, each
//!   carrying its own coefficient, so they are modelled as enums rather than free
//!   integers.
//!
//! Per ClinRisk's licence terms, the official disclaimer ([`DISCLAIMER`]) is
//! carried in every response: an inaccurate implementation could lead to wrong
//! treatment, so the score must be checked against the original at qfracture.org.

// The coefficients below carry more decimal places than an f64 can represent;
// they are kept exactly as ClinRisk published them so the transcription is
// verifiable digit-for-digit against the source. Rust rounds each to the nearest
// f64 just as the original C compiler does, so the extra digits are faithful, not
// misleading - hence the allow rather than truncating the published values.
