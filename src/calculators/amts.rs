//! AMTS - Abbreviated Mental Test Score (Hodkinson 1972).
//!
//! A 10-item bedside screen for cognitive impairment in older patients, each
//! item scoring 1 point for a correct answer for a total of 0-10. A score below
//! 8 (i.e. 7 or less) suggests cognitive impairment - which may be dementia,
//! delirium, or another cause - at the time of testing and warrants further,
//! more formal assessment. It is a screen, not a diagnosis, and does not
//! distinguish dementia from delirium.
//!
//! Each item is a clinician-asserted predicate: TRUE means the patient answered
//! that item correctly. The address item (Q3) is given at the start and recalled
//! at the end, so its TRUE condition is correct recall, not correct repetition.
